name: patch-boss-rush
description: A fast, fully self-contained remediation pass on a single pasted security finding (SAST, SCA, Secrets, IaC, or DAST), no app-context loading, no dependency-health lookups, no delegation to any other skill in this plugin. Does its own compact sanity check, plans a fix, applies it on approval, shows the diff, and optionally opens a PR. Trigger this whenever the user asks to "just fix this," "quick fix," "rush this," or wants fast remediation on a finding that's probably simple, without the full context-gathering ceremony. For the deliberate, context-aware workflow (app context, dependency staleness tradeoffs), that's `patch-for-the-high-score` instead.

# Patch Boss Rush

## Why this skill exists

Not every finding needs the full ceremony. A single obvious SQL injection in one function, a secret that clearly needs rotating, a dependency with a one-line patched version bump, these don't need an app-context file loaded first or a dependency's full maintenance history pulled up. This skill is the fast lane: read the finding, do a short sanity check with its own logic, plan a fix, get approval, apply it, show the diff. It is deliberately **standalone**, it does not read `.SEC-Arcade-save_states/MINI_MAP.md`, does not call `dead_weight_scan.py`, and does not delegate to `player-two-verdict`'s investigation checklists. Everything here is this skill's own, compact version of the same idea.

"Rush" describes how much ceremony a single finding gets, not how many findings get processed per run. This still handles one finding at a time.

## When to use this

- The user wants a finding fixed fast, and it looks like a self-contained, probably-simple case.
- The user explicitly asks to skip the full workflow.
- No `.SEC-Arcade-save_states/` context exists yet and the user doesn't want to generate it just to fix one finding.

If the finding is genuinely complex, touches security-sensitive business logic, or the user wants dependency staleness/tech-debt considered as part of an SCA fix, that's [`patch-for-the-high-score`](../patch-for-the-high-score) instead, it loads real app context and dependency health data before deciding.

On a bare "fix this" with no urgency/speed signal either way, default to `patch-for-the-high-score`, the safer, context-loaded path. Only take this skill when the request itself signals speed ("quick," "just," "rush") or explicitly opts out of the full workflow.

## Step 1: Parse & smoke test

Extract from whatever's pasted: tool name, rule ID, CWE/CVE, reported severity, file/line or package/version, code snippet, secret type/location, resource/template path. If a critical field like a line number is missing, find it yourself with grep or search rather than asking. If a bare CVE/CWE ID has no real description attached, web search it before going further, you need to know what the vulnerability actually is.

Confirm this is a git repo (`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`), confirm the current branch (`git branch --show-current`), confirm any file path the finding names actually exists in this working tree. If something doesn't match, stop and ask rather than guessing.

## Step 2: Classify

- **First-party** (SAST, IaC, DAST): code or config this team wrote.
- **OSS dependency** (SCA): a third-party package.
- **Secret**: its own bucket regardless of source tool, it gets the rotation callout below instead of a full investigation.

## Step 3: Quick check

One short pass, not an exhaustive trace. The goal is the same as anywhere else in this plugin, find a specific reason the finding is wrong before accepting it's right, but the depth here is intentionally shallow:

- **SAST / DAST**: does the flagged input reach the sink without sanitization, encoding, or parameterization in between. One clear check, not a multi-hop trace through every possible caller.
- **SCA**: is the vulnerable function actually imported or called anywhere in first-party code (one-hop check, not a full call-graph trace), and what's the pinned version vs. the patched version.
- **Secrets**: is this a live credential, or a placeholder/example/test fixture.
- **IaC**: what's the actual effective configuration for the flagged resource, not just what the raw template shows.

If this turns up a clear, specific reason the finding isn't real, say so plainly and stop. Evidence-cited, same as everywhere else in this plugin, just without a five-level confidence scale: always state a plain confidence word (High / Medium / Low) in the output header, not just when it's non-obvious.

### Secrets fast path

If Step 3 found a live credential, the very first line of output, before anything else, is an urgent **"ROTATE THIS CREDENTIAL NOW"** callout with its scope and privilege. This skill can't rotate it, that happens outside the codebase and is the user's to do immediately. The code-side fix (remove the hardcoded value, load from an env var or secret manager) still goes through Step 4.

## Step 4: Plan the fix

Only if Step 3 didn't already rule the finding out.

- **Check OWASP guidance as an input, not a gate**: check whether `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/owasp-cheat-sheet-series.md`, the full 120-sheet OWASP Cheat Sheet Series catalog, has a sheet relevant to this finding's specific topic. Match directly on the vulnerability or technology involved (a JWT finding matches the JSON Web Token Cheat Sheet, an SSRF finding matches Server-Side Request Forgery Prevention), not through an OWASP Top 10 category. Advisory, always worth a look, never blocking. If something fits, let it shape the fix and name the sheet in the plan. If nothing fits, move on without forcing it.
- **Complexity gate**: trivial means a few lines, at most 2 files, no schema/API changes, a clear blast radius. If it touches more than 2 files, requires a schema/API change, or has an unclear blast radius, stop: call `EnterPlanMode` and work it out with the user through Claude Code's normal plan-mode workflow instead of the fast path below. Say plainly which condition tripped the gate.
- **Trivial path**: write the fix plan, max 6 sentences, plain language a junior engineer could follow, no unexplained jargon. Present it, then `AskUserQuestion` (proceed / don't fix). Only touch a file after explicit approval.

## Step 5: Apply & show diff

Apply the approved fix. Show the full `git diff`. Never run `git commit` or `git push` here. The change sits uncommitted in the working tree, the user's to review and commit.

## Step 6: Offer a PR

After the diff is shown, ask via `AskUserQuestion` whether to turn this into a PR.

- **If yes**: propose a branch name and PR title/body, the user can override either, then create the branch, commit with a message describing the fix and citing the finding, push, and run `gh pr create` following this environment's standard Summary/Test-plan PR template.
  - Branch: `fix/<category>-<short-slug>`, e.g. `fix/sast-sqli-users-api`, `fix/sca-lodash-cve-2021-xxxxx`, `fix/secret-hardcoded-api-key`.
  - PR title: `Fix: <plain description> (<CWE-XXX or CVE-XXXX-XXXX or package@version>)`.
- **If no**: stop, leave the diff in the working tree.

## Voice and format

- No em dashes.
- Plain, direct, evidence-cited. Shorter than `patch-for-the-high-score`'s output by design, this skill trades depth for speed.
- No narration of intermediate steps, only the structured output below.

Use this structure:

```
⚡ [FIRST-PARTY / OSS DEPENDENCY / SECRET] - [FIX NOW / FALSE POSITIVE] | Confidence: [High / Medium / Low]
[🚨 ROTATE THIS CREDENTIAL NOW - secrets only, live credential, appears above everything else]

Summary: [2-3 plain-language sentences, no jargon, no citations]

Evidence:
- `path/file.ext:line`, `functionOrSymbolName()`: [factual, no interpretation]
[1-3 bullets, kept short]

Fix Plan (max 6 sentences, junior-engineer clear):
1. ...
[cite the relevant OWASP Cheat Sheet by name here if one applied]

Action: [what happens next, tied to the AskUserQuestion below]
```

```
[AskUserQuestion: proceed with this fix / don't fix]
[or, if the complexity gate tripped: EnterPlanMode instead of the block above]
```

After approval and apply:

```
Diff:
[git diff output, in full]

[AskUserQuestion: create a branch + PR for this? yes, with proposed branch/title / no]
```

## Reference material

- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/owasp-cheat-sheet-series.md`: the full OWASP Cheat Sheet Series catalog, used in Step 4 as advisory input on the fix approach. This is the only shared reference this skill uses, it's a static lookup table, not another skill's behavior or artifact.
